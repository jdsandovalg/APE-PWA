name: Netlify Deploy (disabled)

# This workflow previously deployed to Netlify. Netlify deploys were removed
# from project scripts in favor of Vercel/FTP/rsync-based flows. The workflow
# is kept as a disabled placeholder so historical references remain, but it
# will only print a message when triggered.
